# Readable Project

This is my version of the Readable project from Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

## Server
First of all, install and start the API server. [On api's directory](api-server):
* install all server dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `node server`

## Development
To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## What You're Getting

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
